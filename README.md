<h1> Welcome to DiplomacyTT </h1>
<h2>A real-time multiplayer game </h2>
<p>
I created this web-game a few weeks later than I created this same game on Tabletop Simulator, this was my first attempt to learn and create something on javascript, dealing with how to set up the rules and logic behind the curtains, how to create an interactive map world map, how to deal with multiplayer real-time interactions, create unique rooms at the same time, how to keep track of every move the players made in different rooms, at the end, I struggleed a lot to implement the back end of this project but it worked, i'm gratefull to Ankle and Moharu, my friends that guided me through this journey.

I'm a gamer person and i love strategy and resources management games, this was my attempt to create something like that, feel free to test, any feedback will be welcome.

To begin this project I used javascript to implement the rules and the logic, after that i created the UI using CSS and the map using Figma, merged the logic with the interactive map using SVG with eventlisteners. When the logic was ready I started to thinking how the multiplayer component should work, in my studies I learned how to implement WebSockets to create a real-time multiplayer session. After all i deployed the game on Heroku App, using NodeJS to create the servers managing all the rooms for the players and Ably to manage the real-time structure.
